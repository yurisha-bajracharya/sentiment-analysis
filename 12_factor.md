# 12-Factor Implementation Details

This document explains how this FastAPI application implements each of the 12-Factor App principles.

## 1. Codebase: One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys

- Single Git repository containing all code
- Clear separation of application code from configuration
- CI workflow support for testing different deployments

## 2. Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

- All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Using pip and virtual environments for dependency isolation
- No implicit system dependencies

## 3. Config: Store configuration in the environment

- Configuration managed via environment variables
- `.env` file used for local development
- `.env.example` to document required variables
- Abstracted via Pydantic settings class (`app/config.py`)

## 4. Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources

- Designed to treat external services as resources
- No direct coupling to specific implementations
- Easy to swap out services in different environments (e.g., development vs. production)

## 5. Build, release, run: Strictly separate build and run stages

- Dockerized application with clear stages:
  - Build: Docker build stage (dependencies, code)
  - Release: Configuration injection via environment variables
  - Run: Running the container with the specified command

## 6. Processes: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

- Stateless API design
- No persisted files or session state in memory
- Ready for horizontal scaling

## 7. Port binding: Export services via port binding

- Self-contained web server via Uvicorn
- Configurable port via environment variables
- No reliance on external web servers

## 8. Concurrency: Scale out via the process model

- FastAPI's asynchronous support allows handling multiple concurrent requests
- Horizontally scalable (can run multiple instances)
- Allows for process-based scaling

## 9. Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

- FastAPI has quick startup time
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Error handling designed to maintain stability

## 10. Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

- Consistent environment configuration across stages
- Docker ensures consistent execution environment
- Environment-specific configuration isolated to environment variables

## 11. Logs: Treat logs as event streams

- Centralized logging configuration
- Logs directed to stdout/stderr (not files)
- Structured logging with consistent formatting
- Log levels configurable via environment

## 12. Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

- Tests are one-off processes using the same codebase
- CI workflow provides automated test execution
- Application designed to be easily extended with admin commands

## Additional Best Practices

- **API Versioning**: Structured for API versioning
- **Health Checks**: Implemented for monitoring
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs via FastAPI
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses
